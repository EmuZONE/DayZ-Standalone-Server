Balota is a town on the southern coast of Chernarus+ that lies between Chernogorsk and Komarovo.

There is a water pump on the western side of the town, near a house by the road. Balota has a harbor where there is a warehouse.

Balota is a high traffic area due to the neighboring military settlement and because the town is by the coast where new players may spawn.
